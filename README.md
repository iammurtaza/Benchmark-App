# Benchmark-App
SHA1 and MD5 computation testing CPUs raw performance. Lower the score, faster the CPU.

This was a personal project to create a simple benchmark app with which we can measure the performance of various CPUs in the
market. 

At the first step, a for loop is run a 100 million times then a default test string is converted to SHA hash 30 thousand times and
after that, the same default string is converted to MDA5 hash 30 thousand times again.

Time required for each individual operation is marked using time stamps.

A final score is then issued to the user averaging the 3 steps which give us an idea of the raw performance of the CPU under test.
